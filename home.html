                    <div class="fact-title">YOU are the future</div>
                    <p>Space exploration is becoming increasingly important for understanding our universe and
                        addressing global issues! Studying space leads to groundbreaking technology, helps us understand
                        climate change, improves communication systems, and prepares us for future challenges.
                        Many tools we use today, like GPS, satellite weather systems, and even medical devices, were
                        developed through space research.
                        Most important of all, the future of space depends on YOU. Whether you want to be a scientist,
                        engineer, programmer, or something entirely new, YOU will lead the next missions to the Moon,
                        Mars, and beyond.
                        The discoveries of tomorrow will come from the questions you ask and the work you start today.
                        Keep learning, stay curious, and be ready to shape the future! </p>
