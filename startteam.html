            <h2>Form a STEM Club</h2>
            <p class="medium-text">Whether at your school or community center, starting a STEM club is the first step
                toward exploring science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in a collaborative environment. <span
                    class="highlight">Diversity and collaboration are key!</span> Invite students with interests in
                coding, electronics, space, writing, event organizing, and more. The more perspectives, the stronger
                your team.</p>
