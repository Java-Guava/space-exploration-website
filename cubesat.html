                    CubeSats are small, cube-shaped satellites that are perfect for
                    understanding space technology! They are made up of standard units
                    called "U" (1U = 10cm by 10cm by 10cm) and can be stacked to create
                    larger satellites with more capabilities like 2U, 3U, or even 12U
                    sizes! These satellites are lightweight and more cost-effective than
                    traditional satellites, making them ideal for educational projects.
